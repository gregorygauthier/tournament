Abstract base class for a paired tournament.

The PairedTournament class represents management of a tournament
wherein all players are paired round by round.  The PairedTournament
intends to include an algorithm that deterministically pairs
players based upon the results of previous rounds.  Examples of
such algorithms include:
* round-robin tournaments
* Swiss pairs
* minimum-weight matching based algorithms
The algorithm also contains a winner function that returns a frozenset
of one or more players who are declared winners based upon the scoreboard
